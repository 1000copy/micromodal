## Contributing
- MicroModal follows the [standardjs](https://standardjs.com/) coding standard.
- This project uses `yarn` as its package manager of choice, be sure to have this installed on your machine and run `yarn install` in the root folder to install all dependencies
- Run `yarn dev` to start a dev server. This serves the example directory and live reloads when any files are changed
- [Optional] Run `yarn build` to build the files for distribution. This is run automatically as a pre-commit hook as well.
